# Mi-Pro-Scripts
Some scripts to make life better and give audio and brightness controls in i3.
Also includes profiles for tlp and intel-undervolt (thanks to https://github.com/kitsunyan/intel-undervolt). The Mi Patches archive contains patches written by http://en.miui.com/space-uid-2250955959.html to allow for undervoltung and a tweaked fan curve. ALL credit and thanks to __Cyb__!!!
Apply any of these at ur own risk, I take no responsibility for bricked devices and do not maintain any of these scripts myself, I simply put them here for the sake of having everything in one place!
